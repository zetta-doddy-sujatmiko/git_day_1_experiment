1. Rebase

With rebase someone can change commit message with 'reword' (example: I edited update 3 in feat/payment branch commit message), 
change which commit point a branch start branching from other branch (example: my feat/payment branch changed it's base from 1st commit of master to 11th commit of master), 
squashing many commit into one (example: I squashed commit in feat/payment branch)

2. Cherry Pick

With cherry pick someone can pull a specific commit on other branch by specifying that commit id, later, when the brach that one of its commit cherry picked merged, git notice it and brach merged normally
(example: I cherry picked a helper from branch bugfix/payment because main need that helper without entire bugfix/payment brach merged, then I merge bugfix/payment into main and it did merged normally)
